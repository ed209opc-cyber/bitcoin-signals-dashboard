    "Fear & Greed Index": {
        "what": "A composite sentiment score (0–100) from volatility, momentum, social media, surveys & dominance. It acts as a contrarian signal.",
        "why_matters": "Extreme fear (<25) historically marks the best buying opportunities as it signals panic selling and capitulation, while extreme greed (>75) suggests the market is due for a correction.",
        "historical_context": "During the 2018 bear market bottom, the index stayed below 20 for months. Conversely, it hit 95 during the 2021 bull run peak before the crash.",
        "interpretation": "Low readings suggest undervaluation and high risk-reward for accumulation. High readings suggest the opposite.",
        "accumulation_summary": "When this metric is in a favourable range (Extreme Fear), it historically aligns with stronger accumulation conditions and may indicate improved risk-reward for buying Bitcoin."
    },
    "MVRV Z-Score": {
        "what": "Measures the ratio between Market Value (current price) and Realised Value (average price of all coins on-chain). The Z-score normalises this ratio.",
        "why_matters": "A Z-score below 0 means the market is trading below the average cost basis of all holders, indicating deep value and a potential market bottom.",
        "historical_context": "The Z-score has accurately identified every major cycle top and bottom in Bitcoin's history. The green zone (<0.1) has consistently been the most profitable accumulation range.",
        "interpretation": "The lower the Z-score, the more undervalued the market is relative to its historical norms.",
        "accumulation_summary": "When this metric is in a favourable range (green zone), it historically aligns with stronger accumulation conditions and may indicate improved risk-reward for buying Bitcoin."
